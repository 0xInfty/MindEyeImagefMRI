LAION's Replication Of: *Deep image Reconstruction From Human Brain Activity*
---

As we get the ball rolling i've added a notebook for those who wish to get familiar with some of the datatypes this project will be working with. 

To follow along you will need to grab a few files:
1. A ROI binary mask, which can be found [here](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001506/versions/1.3.1/file-display/sourcedata:sub-01:anat:sub-01_mask_RH_HVC.nii.gz)
2. An MRI scan, located [here](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001506/versions/1.3.1/file-display/sub-01:ses-imagery01:anat:sub-01_ses-imagery01_inplaneT2.nii.gz)
3. A training data sample, in [this repo](https://github.com/KamitaniLab/DeepImageReconstruction/tree/master/data/fmri)
